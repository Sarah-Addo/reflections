1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to be able to work on it from multiple computers or if you want
someone to access it directly from another computer.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that there are not too many commits and so that Git won't ignore a commit that doesn't seem to important to it but is important to the user

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copied repositories from other users that give them credit that you can clone to your local computer and edit to your liking. Clones are exact same repositories that do not give credit to original author. Branches are added to a commit that branches off from the main branch in case you want to keep the original branch the same while wanting to test out some new code.
