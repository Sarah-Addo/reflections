1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize it, a .git folder is created. You need to do it so
git becomes in charge of version control and you can start making commits 
through git.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 Staging area is different because it holds files that you want to commit.
 Working directory has all the projects in your file and the repository holds
 the information of all the commits. It is valuable because it allows you
 to specifify the information that you want to commit

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can compare your staging area with the last commit and make sure
That there is a logical difference between the last commit and the one
That you are a bout to commit
