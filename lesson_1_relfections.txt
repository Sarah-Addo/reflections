1. Viewing a diff between the two versions helped me spot the bug easily
 because I was able to see what was added and removed and I looked 
 closely at what was added to spot the bug.

 2. Having all the different versions of a program will allow you to go
 back adn relearn what you've done so far and allow you to see where you have made mistakes
 or what could be improved on.

 3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 The pros are that you can commit whenever you make a significant change that you feel should
 be documented. You can also lower the amount of commits since it wouldn't be comitting 
 constantly and make it all cluttered. A con would be you have to think and remember to commit.

 4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 Probably because you do more projects with git that contain multiple files and for google docs 
 its less projects that have multiple significant diffeent components and more just like
 a single project that only requires one file.

 5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 You can use git log to look at the commit history. You can use git diff
 to compare two versions of commits and see what changed between those two

 6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? 
 It would make you more confident because you know that you could always revert to a previous
 version if need be

 7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
 I would want to use it for the website that I am currently working on
